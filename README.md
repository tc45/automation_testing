### connect_to_device
This function establishes a connection to a network device using the provided device parameters. The `device` 
parameter should be a dictionary with keys such as `device_type`, `host`, `username`, and `password`. The 
function uses these parameters to create a connection object through Netmiko's `ConnectHandler`. If the connection 
is successful, it returns the connection object, which can be used for further operations on the device. If the 
connection fails, it prints an error message and returns `None`.

### execute_command
The `execute_command` function takes two parameters: `connection` and `command`. The `connection` parameter is a 
Netmiko connection object that represents an established session with a network device. The `command` parameter 
is a string that specifies the command to be executed on the device. The function sends the command to the device 
and returns the output as a string. If there is an issue executing the command, it prints an error message.

### make_configuration_change
This function is used to apply configuration changes to a network device. It accepts two parameters: 
`connection` and `commands`. The `connection` parameter is a Netmiko connection object, while `commands` is a 
list of strings, each representing a configuration command. The function sends the list of commands to the 
device in configuration mode and returns the output of the configuration change. If an error occurs during 
this process, it prints a failure message and returns "Failed to connect".

### transfer_file
The `transfer_file` function facilitates the transfer of files to or from a network device over SCP. It 
requires four parameters: `connection`, `source_file`, `dest_file`, and an optional `file_action`. The 
`connection` parameter is a Netmiko connection object. `source_file` is the path to the source file on 
the local system, and `dest_file` is the destination file path on the remote device. The `file_action` 
parameter determines the direction of the transfer ('put' for uploading to the device or 'get' for downloading 
from the device). The function initiates the file transfer and prints the result, including any errors encountered.

### enable_session_logging
The `enable_session_logging` function enables logging for a Netmiko session. It takes two parameters: 
`connection` and an optional `log_file`. The `connection` parameter is a Netmiko connection object, 
and `log_file` is the name of the file where the session log will be saved. By default, the log file is 
named "session_log.txt". The function opens the specified log file in write mode and attaches it to the 
Netmiko connection object for logging all session output.



### connect_and_execute
This function simplifies the process of connecting to a network device and executing a command. It takes two 
parameters: `device_dictionary` and `command`. The `device_dictionary` parameter should be a dictionary 
containing the device connection parameters like `device_type`, `host`, `username`, and `password`. The `command` 
parameter is the command string to be executed on the device. The function establishes a connection, executes the 
command, and prints the output or an error message if the connection or execution fails.

### device_worker
The `device_worker` function is designed to be used with threading to connect to a device and execute a command 
concurrently across multiple devices. It accepts two parameters: `device` and `command`. The `device` parameter 
is a dictionary with the device connection parameters, and the `command` is the command string to be executed. The 
function handles the connection, command execution, and prints the output or an error message if there are issues.

### execute_concurrently
`execute_concurrently` is a function that uses threading to execute a command on multiple devices simultaneously. 
It takes two parameters: `devices` and `command`. The `devices` parameter is a list of dictionaries, each containing 
connection parameters for a device. The `command` parameter is the command string to be executed on each device. The 
function creates a thread for each device, starts them, and waits for all threads to complete before returning.

### execute_interactive_command
This function is used for executing interactive commands that require user input during execution. It takes 
four parameters: `connection`, `command`, `expect_string`, and `response`. The `connection` parameter is a 
Netmiko connection object. The `command` parameter is the command to be executed on the device. The `expect_string` 
parameter is the string to expect before sending the response, indicating the command is waiting for user input. 
The `response` parameter is the response to send when the `expect_string` is detected. The function returns the 
output of the command execution.

### verify_command_output
The `verify_command_output` function checks the output of a command for success or error indicators. It requires 
four parameters: `connection`, `command`, `success_keywords`, and `error_keywords`. The `connection` parameter is a 
Netmiko connection object. The `command` parameter is the command string to be executed on the device. The 
`success_keywords` parameter is a list of keywords indicating successful command execution, while `error_keywords` 
is a list of keywords indicating an error. The function executes the command, searches the output for these keywords, 
and prints messages indicating whether success or error keywords were found.
